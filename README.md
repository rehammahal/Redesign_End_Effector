# Redesign_End_Effector

In this repo, I redesigned the end effector for the fighting robot arm project, as implement a mechanical department task in my summer training at Smart Methods Saudi Company.

First, I drawn and designed the shape using Fusion 360, then I assembled the whole parts of the arm that I got from https://github.com/smart-methods with my new design of end effector using Tinkercad which is easier than Fusion360 in editing and resize the objects.

So, that's all I have.. thank you for reading!
